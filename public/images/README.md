# Static Images

This directory contains static images that will be deployed with the application.

Usage:
1. Place static images in this directory
2. Reference them in your code using absolute paths from the root URL
   Example: `<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />`

Notes:
- Only place static images that are part of the application here
- For user-uploaded content, use Supabase Storage instead
- Keep image sizes optimized for web use
